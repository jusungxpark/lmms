# EDM Production Guide for BANDMATE AI

## Core Music Theory for Electronic Dance Music

### 1. KEY AND SCALE FOUNDATIONS

#### Popular EDM Keys (in order of usage)
1. **A minor** - Dark, powerful, versatile (Deadmau5, Swedish House Mafia)
2. **F minor** - Deep, emotional, club-ready (Martin Garrix, TiÃ«sto) 
3. **G minor** - Balanced, groovy (David Guetta)
4. **C minor** - Dark but accessible (Skrillex)
5. **E minor** - Open, ethereal (Above & Beyond)
6. **D minor** - Classic, versatile (Avicii)

#### Scale Modes for Different Moods
- **Natural Minor (Aeolian)**: Standard EDM, versatile
- **Harmonic Minor**: Middle Eastern vibes, big room drops (raise 7th)
- **Phrygian**: Dark, exotic (lower 2nd) - great for techno
- **Dorian**: Jazzy, sophisticated (raised 6th) - good for deep house
- **Mixolydian**: Happy but cool (major with lowered 7th) - tropical house

### 2. CHORD PROGRESSIONS

#### Essential EDM Progressions
```
i - VI - III - VII  (Am - F - C - G)  [Most common - emotional lift]
i - iv - VI - V     (Am - Dm - F - E)  [Tension and release]
i - VII - IV - VI   (Am - G - D - F)   [Uplifting]
i - VI - iv - V     (Am - F - Dm - E)  [Classic emotional]
VI - VII - i        (F - G - Am)       [Simple but effective]
```

#### Advanced Progressions
```
i - bII - V - i     (Am - Bb - E - Am) [Neapolitan resolution]
i - III - VII - IV  (Am - C - G - D)   [Pop crossover]
i - v - i - VII     (Am - Em - Am - G) [Minimal techno]
```

### 3. SONG STRUCTURE

#### Standard EDM Arrangement (128 bars total)
```
Intro:      8-16 bars  (Drums, atmosphere)
Verse 1:    16 bars    (Add bass, introduce melody)
Build 1:    8 bars     (Rising tension, filters opening)
Drop 1:     16-32 bars (Full energy, main hook)
Break:      8-16 bars  (Breakdown, melodic focus)
Verse 2:    16 bars    (Variation of verse 1)
Build 2:    8 bars     (More intense than build 1)
Drop 2:     16-32 bars (Variation/evolution of drop 1)
Outro:      8-16 bars  (Wind down for DJ mixing)
```

### 4. RHYTHM AND GROOVE

#### Kick Patterns by Genre
- **House (120-128 BPM)**: Four-on-floor, slight swing
- **Techno (125-135 BPM)**: Straight, punchy, minimal variation
- **Trance (130-140 BPM)**: Four-on-floor with bassline emphasis
- **Dubstep (140 BPM)**: Half-time feel, kick on 1, snare on 3
- **DnB (170-180 BPM)**: Kick on 1, snare on 2 & 4 (half-time)
- **Future Bass (150-160)**: Syncopated, trap-influenced
- **Progressive (122-126)**: Subtle variations, evolving patterns

#### Hi-Hat Groove Principles
- **Closed hats**: Drive rhythm forward, usually 8th or 16th notes
- **Open hats**: Accent off-beats or transitions
- **Velocity variation**: 60-80% for groove, 100% for accents
- **Swing**: 5-15% for house, 0% for techno, 20-30% for hip-hop influenced

### 5. BASS DESIGN

#### Bass Frequency Ranges
- **Sub Bass**: 20-60 Hz (felt more than heard)
- **Bass**: 60-250 Hz (fundamental frequencies)
- **Low Mids**: 250-500 Hz (warmth and body)

#### Bass Pattern Types
1. **Rolling Bass**: Continuous 16th notes, side-chained
2. **Offbeat Bass**: Plays between kicks
3. **Sub Bass**: Long notes following root
4. **Reese Bass**: Detuned saws, moving filter
5. **FM Bass**: Complex harmonics, dubstep/future bass
6. **Acid Bass**: 303-style, resonant filter sweeps

### 6. MELODY WRITING

#### Melodic Principles
- **Call and Response**: 2-bar question, 2-bar answer
- **Motivic Development**: Take small idea, vary it
- **Contour**: Balance steps and leaps
- **Peak Points**: One climax per phrase
- **Space**: Silence is powerful

#### Hook Creation
- **Repetition**: Same rhythm, different notes
- **Sequence**: Same pattern, different starting note
- **Inversion**: Flip intervals upside down
- **Retrograde**: Play backwards
- **Augmentation**: Double note lengths

### 7. HARMONIC LAYERING

#### Frequency Arrangement
```
HIGH (8k-20kHz):    Cymbals, air, sparkle
HIGH-MID (2k-8kHz): Lead synths, vocal presence
MID (500-2kHz):     Vocals, leads, snares
LOW-MID (250-500Hz): Warmth, chord body
BASS (60-250Hz):    Bass fundamentals
SUB (20-60Hz):      Sub bass, kick fundamental
```

#### Stereo Field
- **Center (Mono)**: Kick, sub bass, lead vocal
- **Narrow (30%)**: Bass, snare, main lead
- **Wide (60%)**: Pads, strings, backing vocals
- **Full Width**: Ambient effects, delays, reverbs

### 8. SOUND SELECTION

#### Essential EDM Instruments/Sounds

##### Drums
- **Kick**: Punchy attack (2-5ms), tuned to key
- **Snare/Clap**: Layer 2-3 for thickness
- **Hi-Hats**: Crisp, not harsh (roll off above 15kHz)
- **Crash**: For transitions and emphasis
- **Ride**: Sustained energy in drops

##### Synths
- **Supersaw**: 7+ detuned saws for big chords
- **Square Lead**: Hollow, cuts through mix
- **FM Bass**: Growls and talking bass
- **Sine Sub**: Pure low frequency
- **Wavetable**: Evolving textures

##### Effects
- **White Noise**: Sweeps and transitions
- **Impacts**: Emphasize drops
- **Risers**: 4-8 bar tension builders
- **Downlifters**: Release after drop

### 9. ENERGY MANAGEMENT

#### Tension and Release Techniques
1. **Filter Automation**: Low-pass opening toward drop
2. **Pitch Risers**: Rising pitch creates anticipation
3. **Rhythm Reduction**: Remove elements before drop
4. **Snare Rolls**: Increasing speed toward drop
5. **Silence**: 1/4 to 1 bar before drop hits

#### Energy Levels (1-10)
```
Intro:    3-4  (Set mood)
Verse:    5-6  (Build interest)
Pre-Drop: 7-8  (Maximum tension)
Drop:     9-10 (Peak energy)
Break:    4-5  (Rest period)
Bridge:   6-7  (Rebuild energy)
```

### 10. GENRE-SPECIFIC RULES

#### Progressive House
- Subtle changes every 8 bars
- Long builds (16-32 bars)
- Emotional melodies in minor keys
- Side-chain compression essential

#### Future Bass
- Chord stacks with 7ths and 9ths
- Vocal chops as instruments
- Heavy side-chain on everything
- Supersaws with movement

#### Techno

### 11. MIXING PRINCIPLES

#### Gain Staging
- Kick: -6 to -3 dB
- Bass: -12 to -9 dB
- Leads: -15 to -12 dB
- Pads: -18 to -15 dB
- FX: -24 to -18 dB

#### EQ Guidelines
- High-pass everything except kick/bass (80-120 Hz)
- Boost presence (5-8 kHz) for clarity
- Cut muddiness (200-400 Hz)
- Surgical cuts for resonances

#### Compression
- Kick: 4:1 ratio, fast attack
- Bass: 3:1 ratio, medium attack
- Leads: 2:1 ratio, slow attack
- Mix bus: 1.5:1 ratio, slow attack

### 12. AUTOMATION ESSENTIALS

#### What to Automate
1. **Filter Cutoff**: Energy management
2. **Volume**: Dynamic interest
3. **Reverb**: Space changes
4. **Delay Feedback**: Transitions
5. **Distortion**: Intensity changes
6. **Pitch**: Risers and drops
7. **Stereo Width**: Contrast sections

#### Automation Curves
- **Linear**: Standard changes
- **Exponential**: Natural crescendos
- **Logarithmic**: Quick changes then plateau
- **S-Curve**: Smooth transitions

### 13. MUSICAL MATHEMATICS

#### Beat Division
```
Whole Note    = 192 ticks (4 beats)
Half Note     = 96 ticks  (2 beats)
Quarter Note  = 48 ticks  (1 beat)
8th Note      = 24 ticks  (1/2 beat)
16th Note     = 12 ticks  (1/4 beat)
32nd Note     = 6 ticks   (1/8 beat)

Triplets:
8th Triplet   = 16 ticks
16th Triplet  = 8 ticks
```

#### Harmonic Series (for sound design)
```
Fundamental: 1x (Root)
2nd:        2x (Octave)
3rd:        3x (Octave + Fifth)
4th:        4x (2 Octaves)
5th:        5x (2 Octaves + Major 3rd)
6th:        6x (2 Octaves + Fifth)
7th:        7x (2 Octaves + Minor 7th)
8th:        8x (3 Octaves)
```

### 14. CREATIVE TECHNIQUES

#### Chord Voicing
- **Spread Voicing**: Notes across octaves
- **Close Voicing**: Notes within one octave
- **Drop 2**: Drop second highest note down octave
- **Quartal**: Stack fourths instead of thirds
- **Extended**: Add 7ths, 9ths, 11ths

#### Melodic Devices
- **Pedal Point**: Repeated note while harmony changes
- **Ostinato**: Repeated rhythmic pattern
- **Countermelody**: Secondary melody in harmony
- **Blue Notes**: b3, b5, b7 for soul
- **Chromatic Passing**: Connect scale notes

### 15. WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION

#### Production Order
1. **Drums**: Establish groove
2. **Bass**: Lock with kick
3. **Chords**: Harmonic foundation
4. **Lead**: Main melody
5. **FX**: Transitions and atmosphere
6. **Arrangement**: Structure the track
7. **Automation**: Add movement
8. **Mix**: Balance and polish

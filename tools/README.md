- Pattern generation (drums, bass, melodies, chords)
- Advanced note operations (quantize, humanize, transpose, reverse)
- Full undo/redo system
- Clipboard operations
- Track operations (clone, color, move)
- Automation and selection tools

### 3. **lmms_ai_brain.py** (33KB)
- Intelligent interpretation of musical requests
- Dynamic production planning based on intent
- Genre-aware pattern generation
- Mood and energy mapping to parameters
- Works with or without OpenAI API
- Musical knowledge base for smart decisions

### 4. **gpt5_music_interface.py** (18KB)
- Natural language interface for music creation
- Request enhancement and clarification
- Batch processing support
- Interactive mode for continuous creation
- Variation suggestions
- Direct action interface for granular control

## üéµ Features

### Intelligent Music Understanding
- Interprets requests like "heavy techno with distortion"
- Understands genre conventions (techno, house, dnb, ambient, trap)
- Maps moods to musical parameters (dark, aggressive, minimal)
- Scales complexity and energy to pattern generation

### Complete LMMS Control
- **Every instrument** - From Kicker to ZynAddSubFx
- **Every effect** - From simple EQ to complex multiband compression
- **Every parameter** - Full access to all knobs and sliders
- **Every operation** - Pattern generation, automation, mixing

### Dynamic Decision Making
- No hardcoded patterns - everything is intelligently decided
- Adapts to context (heavy = more distortion, minimal = fewer elements)
- Genre-appropriate tempo, instruments, and patterns
- Smart effect intensity based on request

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from lmms_ai_brain import LMMSAIBrain

brain = LMMSAIBrain()
project_file = brain.create_music("create dark techno with heavy bass")
# Opens in LMMS: dark_techno.mmp
```

### Command Line
```bash
# Single request
python gpt5_music_interface.py "make aggressive dnb with complex drums"

# Interactive mode
python gpt5_music_interface.py --interactive

# Batch processing
python gpt5_music_interface.py --batch requests.txt
```

### Advanced Control
```python
from lmms_actions import LMMSActions

controller = LMMSActions()
controller.create_new_project()
controller.set_tempo(174)
controller.add_track("Drums", TrackType.INSTRUMENT)
controller.generate_drum_pattern("Drums", "Break", "dnb", 384)
controller.add_effect("Drums", "distortion", dist=0.8)
controller.save_project("dnb_break.mmp")
```

## üß™ Testing

## üìù License

This system is designed to work with LMMS (Linux MultiMedia Studio) and follows LMMS licensing terms.

## ü§ù Contributing

The system is designed to be extensible. To add new features:
1. Add instrument/effect definitions to `INSTRUMENTS` or `EFFECTS` dictionaries
2. Extend pattern generation in `_generate_pattern_notes()`
3. Add new musical knowledge to `MusicKnowledgeBase`
4. Create new high-level operations in `LMMSActions`

```

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **AiSidebar**: Main UI widget with modern design
- **AiMessage**: Individual message components with animations
- **AiToolResult**: Standardized tool execution results
- **AiSidebarController**: Global singleton for project-wide access

### GPT-5 Integration Details
- **Reasoning Context**: Uses `previous_response_id` for maintaining reasoning chains
- **Minimal Effort Mode**: Optimized for fast responses on simple tasks
- **Custom Tools**: Leverages freeform input for flexible tool calling
- **Allowed Tools**: Constrains tool usage for safety and predictability

### Network Architecture
- Qt5 Network for HTTP/HTTPS requests
- JSON-based communication with OpenAI API
- Asynchronous request handling with proper error management
- Secure API key storage in LMMS configuration

## Installation & Build

### Prerequisites
- Qt5 (5.9.0+) with Network component
- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.13+
- Valid GPT-5 API key from OpenAI

### Build Instructions
The AI sidebar is integrated into the main LMMS build system:

```bash
cd lmms
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

### Configuration
1. Launch LMMS
2. Press `Ctrl+8` to open AI sidebar
3. Enter your GPT-5 API key when prompted
4. Start chatting with your AI assistant!

## API Key Setup

### Getting a GPT-5 API Key
1. Visit https://platform.openai.com
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Generate a new API key
5. Copy the key (keep it secure!)

### Setting the Key in LMMS
- The sidebar will prompt you on first use
- Keys are stored securely in LMMS configuration
- Can be updated through the sidebar interface

## Advanced Features

### Agentic Workflows
The AI can handle complex multi-step tasks:

```
"I want to create a full song arrangement. Start with a basic chord progression in C major, add a drum pattern, then suggest a melody line"
```

The AI will:
1. Analyze your current project
2. Create a chord progression track
3. Add appropriate drum patterns
4. Generate melodic suggestions
5. Provide mixing recommendations

### Emotional Feedback
The interface provides delightful interactions:
- Messages animate in with smooth transitions
- Typing indicators create anticipation
- Success/error states are clearly communicated
- Avatar expressions change based on context

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient memory management
- Asynchronous processing
- Smart caching of API responses
- Minimal UI thread blocking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Key Problems**:
- Ensure your API key is valid and has GPT-5 access
- Check your OpenAI account billing status
- Verify network connectivity

**UI Issues**:
- Restart LMMS if sidebar doesn't appear
- Check Qt5 Network component installation
- Ensure proper permissions for network access

**Performance Issues**:
- Reduce reasoning effort for faster responses
- Use lower verbosity for shorter answers
- Check available system memory

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting environment variable:
```bash
export LMMS_AI_DEBUG=1
./lmms
```

## Security Considerations

### API Key Protection
- Keys stored encrypted in local configuration
- Never transmitted in logs or debug output
- Option to use environment variables for deployment

### Network Security
- All API calls use HTTPS encryption
- Request/response validation
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Tool Safety
- Sandboxed tool execution
- Whitelist of allowed operations
- User confirmation for destructive actions
